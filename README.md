## Week 1: Launching Airbnb Sydney!!
### Welcome to this first week's project for SQL Crash Course!

This week's lecture and material on CoRise showed you how to retrieve data directly from a database. For this project we further your understanding of these concepts by delving a bit deeper. However, for everything covered in this project you can find related examples in our course material.

## Week 2: Summarize data of Airbnb Sydney!

### Welcome to the project for week 2 of our SQL Crash Course! 
To earn your certificate in this class, you must submit both assignments. If you need any help, post in the questions channel on Slack or attend Office Hours. We're here to help you!

This week, we went over ways to aggregate your data and learned other intricacies of SQL. We will implement these concepts in this week's project, but as you know, with a slight twist. You are still the General Manager at Airbnb Sydney, and you'll again encounter some scenarios that you'll solve by using SQL!
